# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
## Overview
For my final project, I will mint an ERC20 token (called Pau token) on deploy, and allow users to purchase the token from the contract.

# Running the Project
The front end is run as a webpage by opening `src/index.html`

The backend smart contract can be run via truffle. After  

To run the smart contracts, first download [truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation). Afterwards. you can run a local blockchain on port 9545 via:
```
truffle develop
...
truffle(develop)>migrate
```

You can run the unit tests via:
```
truffle develop
...
truffle(develop)> test
```
